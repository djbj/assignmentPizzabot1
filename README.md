# Sprint 2: Pizzabot – Part 1

Today's assignment is to create a little textbased pizzabot in which you can order pizza on your computer. The goal is to practice on basic programming concepts in Javascript like varaibles, types, if-statements and functions. For this we will use codepen which can run Javascript code easily. 

## How to complete this assignment

### 1. The tools to use

1. Go to [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/) and create a new pen. 
1. Minimize the HTML and CSS window for now, we will only focus on Javascript. 
1. Go to `settings` and select `behaviour`. 
1. Disable `Auto-Updating Preview` and click ok. 
1. You should now get a new button in your penwindow that says `run`. 
1. Click on `console`in the lower left corner on the page. 
1. Type `console.log("I'm Ready!");`and hit `run`. 
1. If you can se the message `Ì'm ready`in the console, then you are ready to move on. 

### 2. The tools to use

The `starter-code` folder containers a boilerplate html file with the Technigo logo & color scheme to get you started. Feel free to change the theme if you'd like!

To complete this assignment, you need to fork this repository, make changes to your copy, and then submit a pull request on GitHub (from your repository into the technigo one) for review. [Read the guide on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) for more info on how to do this.
